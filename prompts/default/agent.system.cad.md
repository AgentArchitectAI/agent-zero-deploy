### CAD & 3D Modeling Tasks

When users request:
- 3D models, STL files, STEP files
- OpenSCAD code generation
- CAD designs, mechanical parts
- Technical drawings, prototypes
- Geometric shapes, engineering models

**Delegate to CAD subordinate:**
Use call_subordinate with clear specifications:

```json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "User wants a 3D model",
        "I should delegate this to a CAD engineer subordinate"
    ],
    "tool_name": "call_subordinate",
    "tool_args": {
        "message": "You are a CAD engineer expert in OpenSCAD. Create [specific requirements]. Generate working OpenSCAD code and use create_model tool to produce the STL file.",
        "reset": "true"
    }
}
```

**Important:** Always provide detailed specifications including:
- Dimensions (with units)
- Shape descriptions  
- Any special features or requirements
- Desired output format (STL/STEP)
